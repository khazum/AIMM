Okay, let's address the waypoint overshooting issue with your ArduPilot Rover boat, especially considering the added weight affecting its inertia. While the MAVLink commands tell the boat *what* to do (go to waypoint X), the *how* (the steering behavior, acceleration, etc.) is governed by ArduPilot's internal control loops and their tuning parameters. Stock settings are a starting point, but often need adjustment for specific vehicle characteristics like size, weight distribution, and actuator performance.

The core issue is likely that the navigation controller isn't commanding turns early or sharply enough to counteract the boat's momentum, causing it to swing wide past the waypoint or the intended path.

Here's a breakdown of parameters to investigate and adjust, focusing on the navigation and steering control loops:

**1. Primary Navigation Tuning (L1 Controller)**

ArduPilot Rover uses an L1 controller for navigation, which essentially tries to maintain a certain distance (L1 distance) ahead of the vehicle on the desired path and steers towards that point.

*   **`NAVL1_PERIOD`**: This is arguably the **most important parameter** for waypoint tracking accuracy and overshoot. It defines the controller's period or, conceptually, how far ahead the controller looks.
    *   **Effect:** A *smaller* `NAVL1_PERIOD` makes the controller more aggressive, trying to stay closer to the line and reacting faster to deviations. This generally reduces overshoot and corner-cutting but can lead to weaving if set too low. A *larger* value makes navigation smoother but increases the tendency to cut corners on sharp turns and overshoot waypoints, especially with high momentum.
    *   **Action:** Your boat is overshooting. **Try decreasing `NAVL1_PERIOD`**. Default is often around 20. Try values like 18, 15, 12, testing systematically. Reduce it in small steps (e.g., by 1 or 2 at a time) and observe the behavior. Find a balance between reducing overshoot and avoiding excessive weaving along straight path segments.

*   **`NAVL1_DAMPING`**: This controls how the controller damps oscillations around the desired track.
    *   **Effect:** Higher damping smooths the response but can make the approach to the line slower. Lower damping makes it react faster but can cause oscillations.
    *   **Action:** The default is often 0.75. While `NAVL1_PERIOD` is the primary tool for overshoot, you might slightly *increase* damping (e.g., to 0.8 or 0.85) *after* adjusting `NAVL1_PERIOD` if you still see some oscillation or overshoot during the correction phase. However, increasing it too much can also contribute to cutting corners. Usually, adjusting `NAVL1_PERIOD` is more effective for overshoot.

**2. Speed and Turn Adjustments**

Higher speed significantly increases momentum and the likelihood of overshoot.

*   **`WP_SPEED` / `CRUISE_SPEED`**: This is the target speed during missions or in relevant modes.
    *   **Action:** The simplest way to reduce overshoot is to **reduce the target speed**. Test if a lower speed significantly improves tracking. This might not be desirable if speed is critical, but it's a valid tuning variable.

*   **`SPEED_TURN_GAIN` / `SPEED_TURN_DIST`**: These parameters allow the vehicle to automatically slow down before turns.
    *   **Effect:** `SPEED_TURN_DIST` sets a distance before a waypoint turn, and `SPEED_TURN_GAIN` (0-100) determines *how much* the speed should be reduced based on the sharpness of the turn required. A higher gain means more slowing for sharper turns.
    *   **Action:** **Enable and tune these parameters.** Set `SPEED_TURN_GAIN` to a value like 50-100 and adjust `SPEED_TURN_DIST` (e.g., 5-10 meters, depending on boat size and speed) to give the boat enough time to slow down *before* initiating the turn. This directly combats the momentum issue.

**3. Steering Controller Tuning**

While the L1 controller decides *where* to steer, the steering controller (`STEER2SRV` parameters) determines *how* the steering command is translated into actuator output (rudder angle, differential thrust). If the steering response itself is sluggish, it can contribute to overshoot.

*   **`STEER2SRV_P`, `STEER2SRV_I`, `STEER2SRV_D`, `STEER2SRV_FF`**: These are the PID + Feedforward terms for the steering rate controller.
    *   **Action:** Tuning these is more involved (see the ArduPilot tuning guides). Generally, if the boat seems slow to *start* turning once commanded, you might need to increase `STEER2SRV_FF` (Feedforward) or `STEER2SRV_P` (Proportional gain). Be cautious, as excessive gains can cause oscillations (tail wagging). **Focus on the L1 and speed parameters first**, as they are more directly related to waypoint navigation overshoot. Tune `STEER2SRV` if the boat doesn't turn crisply *even when commanded to*.

**Recommended Tuning Process:**

1.  **Baseline:** Ensure you know your current "stock" values. Connect via Mission Planner or QGroundControl and check the Full Parameter List.
2.  **Reduce Speed:** As a quick test, significantly lower `WP_SPEED` and see if the overshoot improves. This helps confirm momentum is a major factor.
3.  **Tune `NAVL1_PERIOD`:** Set speed back to desired level. Decrease `NAVL1_PERIOD` incrementally (e.g., from 20 down to 18, 16, 15...). Run a simple mission with turns after each change. Observe if overshoot decreases. Stop if the boat starts weaving unacceptably on straight lines.
4.  **Tune Speed Reduction for Turns:** If decreasing `NAVL1_PERIOD` isn't enough or causes weaving, implement turn slowing. Set `SPEED_TURN_GAIN` (e.g., 75-100) and `SPEED_TURN_DIST` (start with ~5m, adjust based on observation).
5.  **Adjust `NAVL1_DAMPING` (Optional):** If needed, try small increases (e.g., 0.75 to 0.8).
6.  **Review Steering Response (`STEER2SRV`):** Only if the boat feels generally sluggish in turns, carefully tune the steering controller parameters by following the ArduPilot documentation's specific guides.
7.  **Test Systematically:** Change only one parameter (or related group like `SPEED_TURN_*`) at a time and test thoroughly. Use telemetry logs to analyze the desired vs. actual heading and track.

Remember that the added weight increases the boat's inertia, meaning it will resist changes in motion (starting turns, stopping turns) more strongly. Therefore, parameters that make the control action more aggressive or anticipate turns earlier (`NAVL1_PERIOD` decrease) or reduce momentum before the turn (`SPEED_TURN_GAIN`/`DIST`) are the most likely solutions.Based on the search results and general ArduPilot tuning principles, here's a refined approach to fixing the waypoint overshooting issue with your boat, especially considering the extra weight:

**1. Understand the Key Controllers**

*   **Navigation Controller (L1 Controller or S-Curves):** This high-level controller determines the desired path and turning radius to get from one waypoint to the next. It generates a target *lateral acceleration* or *turn rate*. Parameters like `NAVL1_PERIOD` (older system) or parameters related to S-Curve navigation (newer systems like Rover 4.4+) influence how aggressively it tries to stay on the line and anticipate turns. [13, 15, 9]
*   **Steering Rate Controller (ATC\_STR\_RAT\_\*):** This lower-level PID controller takes the desired turn rate from the navigation controller and tries to achieve it by commanding the steering actuators (rudder, differential thrust). Parameters like `ATC_STR_RAT_FF`, `ATC_STR_RAT_P`, `ATC_STR_RAT_I` control this. [2, 11]
*   **Speed/Throttle Controller (ATC\_SPEED\_\*):** Controls the boat's speed using a PID controller. Parameters like `ATC_SPEED_P`, `ATC_SPEED_I`, `CRUISE_SPEED`, `CRUISE_THROTTLE` are relevant. [7]

**2. Primary Tuning Parameters for Overshoot**

*   **`NAVL1_PERIOD` (If applicable, older firmware or L1 mode selected):** This is a critical parameter. Overshooting often means the boat turns too late or too gently.
    *   **Action:** **Decrease `NAVL1_PERIOD`**. This makes the navigation more aggressive, tightening turns and reducing the tendency to overshoot. Decrease in small steps (e.g., 0.5 or 1.0) and test. [5, 15] Be careful not to decrease it too much, as it can cause weaving on straight sections. [15, 13]
*   **`NAVL1_DAMPING` (If applicable):** Works with `NAVL1_PERIOD`.
    *   **Action:** You might slightly *increase* damping (e.g., by 0.05) after adjusting `NAVL1_PERIOD` if there's still oscillation, but reducing `NAVL1_PERIOD` is usually the primary fix for overshoot. [13]
*   **S-Curve Parameters (If using Rover 4.4+ and S-Curves):** Newer firmware versions often use S-Curve navigation by default in Auto mode, which plans paths differently. Tuning might involve parameters related to path generation, acceleration, and cornering behavior specific to S-Curves. Check the documentation for your specific firmware version if `NAVL1_PERIOD` seems ineffective or isn't the primary navigation method. Guided mode might use a simpler controller unless configured otherwise (`GUID_OPTIONS`). [9]

**3. Speed Control Parameters**

*   **Reduce `WP_SPEED` / `CRUISE_SPEED`**: Lowering the target speed is a direct way to reduce momentum and thus overshoot. [6] Test if this helps confirm the issue is momentum-related.
*   **`SPEED_TURN_GAIN` / `SPEED_TURN_DIST`**: These allow the boat to automatically slow down for turns.
    *   **Action:** Set `SPEED_TURN_GAIN` to a value between 0-100 (percentage of desired speed to maintain during the turn, lower means more slowing). Set `SPEED_TURN_DIST` to a distance (in meters) before the waypoint where slowing should begin. Enabling and tuning this (e.g., `SPEED_TURN_GAIN` = 50, `SPEED_TURN_DIST` = 5-10m) can be very effective against overshoot caused by high speed into turns. [3, 6, 15]
*   **Deceleration Parameters (`ATC_DECEL_MAX`, potentially `WP_ACCEL`):** ArduPilot uses deceleration limits to plan stopping distances. If the boat isn't slowing down appropriately before waypoints (especially the final one), these might be relevant. Tuning `ATC_DECEL_MAX` might help the boat start slowing earlier to hit the waypoint more precisely. [17, 9, 14] Ensure `WP_ACCEL` is appropriate (likely 0 if you want smooth speed changes). [9]

**4. Steering Rate Controller Tuning (`ATC_STR_RAT_*`)**

*   While less directly related to the *decision* to turn (which is navigation), a poorly tuned steering controller can worsen overshoot if the boat physically reacts sluggishly to turn commands.
    *   **`ATC_STR_RAT_FF` (Feedforward):** This is often the most important gain here. If the boat feels slow to initiate turns, increasing FF might help. If it consistently overshoots the *desired turn rate* itself (oscillates during the turn), FF might be too high. [2, 11]
    *   **`ATC_STR_RAT_P` and `ATC_STR_RAT_I` (Proportional, Integral):** Fine-tune the response. P corrects short-term errors, I corrects long-term steady errors. Often set as a fraction of FF. [2, 11]
    *   **Action:** Follow the specific ArduPilot Rover Steering Rate Tuning guide. [2, 4] This usually involves driving in Acro mode and comparing desired vs. achieved turn rates. [2, 1] Tune this *after* addressing the navigation (L1/S-Curve) and speed parameters.

**5. Other Considerations**

*   **`WP_RADIUS`**: Defines how close the boat needs to pass a waypoint to consider it "hit". Making this smaller won't fix overshoot dynamics but defines the completion target.
*   **`WP_OVERSHOOT`**: Mentioned in some older contexts [3] or specific scenarios [14]. It aimed to limit overshoot distance, potentially by forcing slowdowns. Check if relevant for your version/setup, but modern tuning focuses more on L1/S-Curve and speed control. Note that this parameter might be deprecated or work differently now. [3, 16]
*   **Pivot Turns (`PIVOT_TURN_ANGLE`, `WP_PIVOT_RATE`):** If pivot turns are expected and not happening correctly, it could lead to wide turns appearing like overshoot. Ensure `PIVOT_TURN_ANGLE` is set low enough to trigger pivots when needed. Issues can arise if the boat is still moving forward when trying to pivot. [17]

**Recommended Tuning Strategy:**

1.  **Identify Firmware Version & Navigation Method:** Determine if you are primarily using L1 (`NAVL1_PERIOD`) or S-Curves for navigation in Auto mode.
2.  **Reduce Speed:** Temporarily lower `WP_SPEED` to confirm momentum is the key issue.
3.  **Tune Navigation Aggressiveness:** Decrease `NAVL1_PERIOD` (if L1) or adjust relevant S-Curve parameters to make turns tighter/earlier. Test iteratively.
4.  **Tune Turn Speed Reduction:** Implement/tune `SPEED_TURN_GAIN` and `SPEED_TURN_DIST` to slow the boat before turns.
5.  **Tune Deceleration:** If stopping precision at the final waypoint is an issue, investigate `ATC_DECEL_MAX`. [17]
6.  **Tune Steering Rate:** Only if the boat's physical turning response seems poor, tune the `ATC_STR_RAT_*` parameters using the dedicated guide. [2]
7.  **Use Logging:** Analyze telemetry logs (desired vs. actual heading, speed, cross-track error) to objectively assess the impact of parameter changes.
8.  **Consider QuickTune Script:** For newer firmware, the Rover QuickTune Lua script can help automate finding initial PID values for steering and speed controllers in Circle mode. [8, 10]

Start with `NAVL1_PERIOD` (or equivalent S-Curve tuning) and `SPEED_TURN_GAIN`/`DIST`, as these most directly address waypoint overshoot due to momentum and turning dynamics.
